# Hive Puzzle Simulator
After playing the Shadowkeep expansion I gotten obliterated by the Hive tile puzzles and had to look up a guide on how to beat them.
So to compensate for being a massive loser, I made a reproduction of the puzzles with javax UI.
- [X] Includes all 4 hive symbols
- [X] Cycles through all of them (may not be in accurate order)
- [X] Ability to mess around and just push buttons without needing to worry about primary ammo running out
- [X] Generate new, reset to previous seed, and undo buttons
- [ ] Ability to enter your own seeds
- [X] Everyone's favorite light blue javax buttons and window UI
