# Hive Tile Puzzle Simulator
After playing the Shadowkeep expansion, I've gotten obliterated by the Hive tile puzzles and had to look up a guide on how to beat them.
So to compensate for being a massive loser, I made a reproduction of the puzzles in java. They won't help me be better at them, but oh well, maybe in Witch Queen this'll have more use.
